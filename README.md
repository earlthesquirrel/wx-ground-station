# Automated Weather Satellite Ground Station

This project allows you to create a fully automated ground station that will receive and decode NOAA weather satellite images and upload them to your own website served from an Amazon AWS S3 bucket. [See my example S3 site](http://nootropicdesign.wx.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).
For full details of the project, see the [full project writeup on the Project Lab blog](https://nootropicdesign.com/projectlab/2019/11/08/weather-satellite-ground-station/).

The scripting in this project is largely based on the excellent work by [Jim Haslett](https://www.youtube.com/user/JimHaslett) as described in his well-written Instructable, [Raspberry Pi NOAA Weather Satellite Receiver](https://www.instructables.com/id/Raspberry-Pi-NOAA-Weather-Satellite-Receiver/).

Earl Baugh has done the conversion to Python as well as change code where necessary to support running S3 on TrueNas or FreeNAS
